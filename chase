<h1>The Rebel Force</h1>
<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>

<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I call it luck. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>

<li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</li>

<h3>The Clone Wars</h3>
<p>Red Five standing by. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. What!? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
