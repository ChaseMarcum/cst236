I am using GIT HUB with visual studio 2012. 
Using the Add-ins look for Git Hub. They have
a very nice way of working with project files.

Couple things I notice. When working from within 
Visual Studio going to the command line doesnt show
the same details when you commit.
Also I didn't see a way to branch. I am sure it is there
I just haven't found it yet. 

Shows a very nice history when you view your changes from
Visual Studio.
